  <h1>About</h1>

  <p>
    Data to Impact is a personal research initiative focused on understanding how data, finance, and sustainability intersect in real-world decision-making.
  </p>

  <p>
    The work here explores financial analysis, ESG metrics, and impact measurement with an emphasis on clarity, rigor, and practical relevance rather than commentary or advocacy.
  </p>

  <p>
    This site serves as a public record of research notes, analytical frameworks, and working papers developed through independent study and applied analysis.
  </p>

  <p>
    The intent is to document learning, test ideas, and build structured insight over time.
